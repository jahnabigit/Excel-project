<h1><B><U>Road Accident dashboard for 2021 and 2022 using MS Excel</U></B></h1>

<h3>1.	Overview:</h3>

In this data analysis project, I have developed a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard using Excel, highlighting the critical statistics and trends related to road accidents. 

The dashboard presents essential insights into Death, serious, and slight casualties, casualties by car, road type, road surface, location/area, light condition, and vehicle type.

<h3>2.	Steps involved in Analysis:</h3>

To develop this dashboard, I employed a systematic approach that encompassed data cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization. By utilizing Excel's functionality, I converted raw data into informative charts, graphs, and interactive visuals for enhanced accessibility.

•	Client requirements gathering</br>
•	Data cleaning according to specifications</br>
•	Customized data processing</br>
•	Data analysis using Pivot Tables and Excel functions</br>
•	Visual data presentation through charts and custom sheets</br>
•	End-to-end report/dashboard creation</br>

<h3>3.	Key insights:</h3>

•	Total number of casualities for both the years is 417883.</br>
•	Out of 417883 casualities 7135 i.e 1.7% are death casualities, 59312 i.e 14.2% are serious casualities and 351436 i.e 84.1% are minor casualities.</br>
•	The number of Car casualities is the highest among all vehicle types, i.e 333485.</br>
•	The road type with the maximum casualities is the Single carriageway i.e 309.7K.</br>
•	After comparing the current and previous years, we got to know that the year with the maximum casualities is 2021.</br>
•	The road surface with the maximum casualities is the Dry i.e 279445.</br>
•	The area/location with the maximum casualities is Urban i.e 255.9k</br>
•	The light condition with the maximum casualities is Daylight i.e 305.0K</br>

<h3>4.	Conclusion:</h3>

Employing Excel for data analysis has enabled us to extract valuable insights regarding road accidents and pinpoint areas in need of urgent attention. Through the application of data visualization techniques, this dashboard equips decision-makers with actionable information for enhancing road safety measures.
